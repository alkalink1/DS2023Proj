This is important for our analysis to see how much work the athlete is doing overall. \n* Player Load Per Minute: Effort per minute (intensity). This is important for our analysis to see the intensity/effort players are putting in. Higher pl per minute means they are most likely sprinting/exerting lots of energy which may take longer recovery.\n* Explosive Efforts: Number of high-intensity movements. This is important because high intensity movements can cause strain on muscles leading to potential injuries.\n* Session Total Jump: Total jumps in a session. This is important because positions that jump a lot may need more recovery due to the strain this puts on tendons. Especially since jumps are very frequent in basketball.\n* Session Jumps Per Minute: Jumps per minute (jump intensity). This can identify positions that may be at risk for knee injury if they have a very high rate of jumps per minutes.\n* Total IMA: Total number of movements (all intensities). This is important to analyze all movement and not just high intensity movement.\n* IMA/Min: Number of movements per minute. This is important to track endurance by position.\n* Position: This is important for our analysis to compare all of our variables against position. \n\n## Cleaning the data\n```{python}\n# import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy as sp\n```\n```{python}\n# load data\nc1 = pd.read_csv('catapult season 1.csv')\nc2 = pd.read_csv('catapult season 2.csv')\n# merge the two seasons using concatonate ignoring their individual indexes\ndf = pd.concat([c1, c2], ignore_index=True)\n```\n```{python}\n#check for duplicates\nduplicates = df.duplicated()\nprint(f\"Number of duplicates: {duplicates.sum()}\")\n#drop duplicates\ndf = df.drop_duplicates()\n#check for missing values\n\n#correct data types\nmissing_values = df.isnull().sum()\n#drop missing values\ndf = df.dropna()\n#check data types\nkey_vars = [\n    'Total Player Load', 'Player Load Per Minute', 'Explosive Efforts', 'Session Total Jump', 'Session Jumps Per Minute', 'Total IMA', 'IMA/Min', 'Position'\n]\ndf = df[key_vars]\n```\n\n## Descriptive Statistics & Distributions\n\n```{python}\n\n#Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, quartiles) for numerical variables\nnumeric = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])\n#numeric = numeric.drop(columns=['Period Number'])\nnumeric = numeric.dropna()\n\n# Create a new dataframe to store summary statistics\nsummary = pd.DataFrame()\n# Calculate summary statistics for each numeric column and add to the dataframe\nfor each in numeric.columns:\n    stats = numeric[each].describe()\n    summary[each] = stats\n\nsummary\n```\n```{python}\n#Create visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, or density plots to explore the distribution of key numerical variables.\nnumeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=['number'])\n\n# Create correlation matrix\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\ncorr = numeric_df.corr()\nsns.heatmap(corr, cmap='coolwarm', annot=False, linewidths=0.5)\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix')\nplt.show()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n#Plotting distribution of Player Load Per Minute\nsns.histplot(df['Player Load Per Minute'], bins=30, kde=True)\nplt.title('Distribution of Player Load Per Minute')\nplt.show()\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# correlation with player load and position\nsns.histplot(df, x=\"Player Load Per Minute\", hue=\"Position\", element=\"step\", common_norm=False)\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n\n## Examine Correlations \n> Interpret findings: what variables appear related?\n```{python}\n\n#seems that tpl and explosive efforts are highly correlated\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.regplot(x='Total Player Load', y='Explosive Efforts', data=df, scatter_kws={'color': 'darkblue'}, line_kws={'color': 'red'})\n#seems to be a linear relationship, which makes sense as more effort in explosive efforts would also increase total player load\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Explore Relationships\n>Dig into potential causal or descriptive relationships \n```{python}\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"Position\", y=\"Total Player Load\", data=df)\nplt.title(\"Player Loads by Position\")\nplt.show()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"Position\", y=\"Explosive Efforts\", data=df)\nplt.title(\"Explosive Efforts by Position\")\nplt.show()\n\nplot = sns.FacetGrid(df, col=\"Position\", col_wrap=3, sharex=True, sharey=True)\nplot.map(plt.hist, \"Total Player Load\", bins=30, color=\"lightblue\",
