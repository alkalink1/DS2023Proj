**The Audience:**It is important for strength and conditioning coaches to understand what kind of training and recovery plans their athletes need. 


**The Problem Statement:**
Each position exerts different levels of player loads within practices and games, how do we ensure that each position is getting their optimal training and recovery in order to perform best in games and prevent injury?


## Important Variables within this Dataset
* Total Player Load: Total physical effort during a session. This is important for our analysis to see how much work the athlete is doing overall. 
* Player Load Per Minute: Effort per minute (intensity). This is important for our analysis to see the intensity/effort players are putting in. Higher pl per minute means they are most likely sprinting/exerting lots of energy which may take longer recovery.
* Explosive Efforts: Number of high-intensity movements. This is important because high intensity movements can cause strain on muscles leading to potential injuries.
* Session Total Jump: Total jumps in a session. This is important because positions that jump a lot may need more recovery due to the strain this puts on tendons. Especially since jumps are very frequent in basketball.
* Session Jumps Per Minute: Jumps per minute (jump intensity). This can identify positions that may be at risk for knee injury if they have a very high rate of jumps per minutes.
* Total IMA: Total number of movements (all intensities). This is important to analyze all movement and not just high intensity movement.
* IMA/Min: Number of movements per minute. This is important to track endurance by position.
* Position: This is important for our analysis to compare all of our variables against position. 

## Cleaning the data
```{python}
# import libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
```
```{python}
# load data
c1 = pd.read_csv('catapult season 1.csv')
c2 = pd.read_csv('catapult season 2.csv')
# merge the two seasons using concatonate ignoring their individual indexes
df = pd.concat([c1, c2], ignore_index=True)
```
```{python}
#check for duplicates
duplicates = df.duplicated()
print(f"Number of duplicates: {duplicates.sum()}")
#drop duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()
#check for missing values

#correct data types
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
#drop missing values
df = df.dropna()
#check data types
key_vars = [
    'Total Player Load', 'Player Load Per Minute', 'Explosive Efforts', 'Session Total Jump', 'Session Jumps Per Minute', 'Total IMA', 'IMA/Min', 'Position'
]
df = df[key_vars]
```

## Descriptive Statistics & Distributions

```{python}

#Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, quartiles) for numerical variables
numeric = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
#numeric = numeric.drop(columns=['Period Number'])
numeric = numeric.dropna()

# Create a new dataframe to store summary statistics
summary = pd.DataFrame()
# Calculate summary statistics for each numeric column and add to the dataframe
for each in numeric.columns:
    stats = numeric[each].describe()
    summary[each] = stats

summary
```
```{python}
#Create visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, or density plots to explore the distribution of key numerical variables.
numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=['number'])

# Create correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
corr = numeric_df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, cmap='coolwarm', annot=False, linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
#Plotting distribution of Player Load Per Minute
sns.histplot(df['Player Load Per Minute'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Player Load Per Minute')
plt.show()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# correlation with player load and position
sns.histplot(df, x="Player Load Per Minute", hue="Position", element="step", common_norm=False)
plt.show()

```


## Examine Correlations 
> Interpret findings: what variables appear related?
```{python}

#seems that tpl and explosive efforts are highly correlated
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.regplot(x='Total Player Load', y='Explosive Efforts', data=df, scatter_kws={'color': 'darkblue'}, line_kws={'color': 'red'})
#seems to be a linear relationship, which makes sense as more effort in explosive efforts would also increase total player load
```




## Explore Relationships
>Dig into potential causal or descriptive relationships 
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.boxplot(x="Position", y="Total Player Load", data=df)
plt.title("Player Loads by Position")
plt.show()

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.boxplot(x="Position", y="Explosive Efforts", data=df)
plt.title("Explosive Efforts by Position")
plt.show()

plot = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Position", col_wrap=3, sharex=True, sharey=True)
plot.map(plt.hist, "Total Player Load", bins=30, color="lightblue", edgecolor="black")
plot.fig.suptitle("Histogram of Total Player Load by Position", y=1.02)
plt.show()

plot = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Position", col_wrap=3, sharex=True, sharey=True)
plot.map(plt.hist, "Player Load Per Minute", bins=30, color="lightblue", edgecolor="black")
plot.fig.suptitle("Histogram of Player Load per Minute by Position", y=1.02)
plt.show()

```
